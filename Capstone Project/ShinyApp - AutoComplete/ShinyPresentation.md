Coursera Data Science Capstone Project
========================================================
author: Luka SantriÄ‡

The presentation will briefly showcase an [application](https://lsantric.shinyapps.io/ShinyApp_-_AutoComplete/) for predicting the next word in a sentance based on previously chosen words.

The application is the capstone project for the Coursera Data Science specialization organized by Johns Hopkins University in cooperation with SwiftKey.

The Objective
========================================================

In the capstone project, the main goal was to build a shiny application that is able to predict the next word a user wants to type. 

It included multiple tasks ranging from data cleansing and exploratory analysis to creation of a predictive model and more.

Data used in this course is available on [HC Corpora](http://www.corpora.heliohost.org/). 

All data processing was done with R and its numerous packages.

Method and modeling
========================================================

After downloading the data set, It was filtered by conversion to lowercase, removing punctuation, links, white spaces, numbers and all special characters.

The data sample was tokenized into [*n*-grams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram).

Those aggregated n-grams frequency matrices have been transferred into frequency dictionaries.

The resulting data tables were used to predict the next word in connection with the input text. 


Using the Application
========================================================

The user interface of this application is very simple. While entering the text, the field with the predicted next word refreshes automatically and the whole input text is displayed.
