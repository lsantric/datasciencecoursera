Basal Metabolic Rate Calculator
==================================

BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate, also known as Resting Metabolic Rate) is the number of Calories a body uses when in a resting state for a complete day. It uses the Harris-Benedict equations to estimate your BMR from gender, weight, height and age. Estimating BMR is important in planning colorie intake to achieve or maintain healthy body weight.

These are the most widely used equations and the only factor they omit is lean body mass. Thus, the ratio of muscle-to-fat a body has. Since muscle burns more calories than fat, these equation tend to underestimate the calorie needs of very muscular people (bodybuilders, some athletes) and overestimate the calorie needs of obese people.

In this repository simple BMR calculator was implemented. It contains:

1. ui.R - file for generating user interface
2. server.R - file for generating backend calculations
3. BMRcalc.md is the Markdown file that generates the R Presenter presentation
4. BMRcalc.html is a HTML compiled from the .md file that generates the presentation hosted on RPubs: http://rpubs.com/lsantric/BMRcalc.
